# SQL
| Project Link | Description | Tools |
|---|---|---|
|:dragon: [Best Pokemon Team](https://github.com/MadelynSwor/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/tree/main/PokemonEDA) | As a long time fan of Pokemon, I thought I'd answer my age old question of finding the best pokemon team in Pokemon X and Y. This project demonstrates my proficiency in SQL, problem solving, and conveying information audiences may not have much knowledge in. | SQL Server and Tableau |
|:red_car: [Population of Electric Vehicles in WA State in 2023](https://github.com/MadelynSwor/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/tree/main/Population_of_Electric_Vehicles) | My analysis answers questions regarding the growing demand for electric vehicles. Questions such as what percent of registered cars are electric, what's the average electric range for PHEVs and BEVs, and which eletric vehicles are more popular with consumers. | SQL Server |



# Python
| Project Link | Description | Libraries |
|---|---|---|
|:clapper: [Netflix Data Analysis](https://github.com/MadelynSwor/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/blob/main/Netflix_Analysis/Netflix_Data_Analysis.ipynb)| I analyzed around 9,000 titles on Netflix. Through python I cleaned and transformed the data. Using matplotlib and seaborn I generated visuals to accompany my data analysis for questions such as top genres, countries, and whether Netflix is more likely to add titles on a certain month.| pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn |
