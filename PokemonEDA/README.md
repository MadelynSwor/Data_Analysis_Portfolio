What is the Best Pokémon Team in Pokémon X&Y?
======
### 1. Introduction

Like many kids who grew up in the early 2000s I loved playing Pokémon. I was in the seventh grade when the sixth installment of the game, Pokémon X & Y, came out. My friends and I became obsessed. Every lunch we’d huddle around our 3DS comparing teams while one person kept lookout for the lunch monitor. While it’s been years since I’ve picked up the game, I thought it’d be fun to answer my 13 year old self’s question. What is the best Pokémon team?

Before diving into the process of picking the best team, what is Pokémon? Pokémon is a franchise that revolves around you, a trainer, collecting monsters called Pokémon. Players start the game by choosing from **_three_ _starter_ _Pokémon_**. From there players are tasked with exploring the world, battling other trainers, and improving your Pokémon team. To progress the game’s story, trainers and their Pokémon team need to defeat **_12_ _gym_ _leaders_**. A big appeal for Pokémon fans is choosing which six Pokémon you put on your team. Going back to my original question, how do you decide the best team?

### 2. Pokémon Types; Advantages and Disadvantages

The first step to building your team is choosing which types of Pokémon. The game has a total of **_18_ _different_ _types_**. Each type has multiple advantages and disadvantages. For example, as shown in the image below, fire is strong against grass but weak against water.
